        <br>
        <p> I made a program to automatically solve nonograms on 
            <a href="https://www.puzzle-nonograms.com">Puzzle Nonograms</a>.
            The program takes in the nonogram dimensions, the html for the hints, 
            the location of the top left corner, and the location for the bottom 
            right corner. Then the program extracts the hints from the html, 
            generates possible permutations, and eliminates them iteratively. 
            Finally, the program uses the pixel locations and the pyautogui library 
            to automatically click the cells. </p>
        <h2> Fluid Flow Simulation </h2>
        <img class="project-img" src="images/darcy.png" alt="Fluid Flow simulation"/>
        <br>
        <p> In my differential equations class, I programmed a MATLAB simulation of 
            fluid flow using Darcy's law. The method involves splitting up 
            the flow regions into cells and assuming the cells have uniform 
            material properties within them. Then the program creates and solves 
            a system of equations, finding the pressure graph in the cells shown 
            above.
